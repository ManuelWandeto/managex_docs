# Transactions Ledger/ Statement of Account

![Transactions Ledger](/img/screenshots/transactions_ledger.PNG)

Put the date range of interest, select account of interest and the data will populate.

## Points to Note

- The transactions ledger will show all debits and credits that affect just the selected account.

- For example for cash/bank/money accounts it’s useful a statement that shows all transactions received or paid between the date range.

- If It’s a stock account, it will show the stock value received between the date range.
