# Item Profit & Loss

![Item Profit & Loss](/img/screenshots/item_p_&_l.PNG)

This report will show how much profit, each product sold between the date range selected, has generated.

It will help you to know the items making the most profit (and revenue).

When you double-click an item from the top list, you will see the dates it was sold in the list at the bottom.
