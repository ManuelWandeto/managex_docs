# Transactions Journal

![Transactions Journal](/img/screenshots/transactions_journal.PNG)

This is where all transactions being integrated into accounts are first posted (automatically).

You donâ€™t need to post any information here, because the system posts the transactions happening in other modules, to this journal automatically.

But for persons with knowledge of accounts, can manually post a transaction, debit, and credit different charts of accounts to balance the balance sheet.
