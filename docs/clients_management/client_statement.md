![Client Statement](/img/screenshots/client_statement.PNG) 

The statement shows a history of transactions that were engaged with a client, the sales made to the client (i.e. invoices) and the payments the client has made. 

In the example shown, the client was invoiced for order no 70, amount 11,305, and 1 day later paid 12,000 with a cheque 0100. 
The moving balance shows there was balance before, and to see more details you can change the start date to increase the date range.
