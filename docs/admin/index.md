# Efficient Administration with Managex

The Admin Module serves as the central hub for managing critical aspects of your software ecosystem. Within this module, you’ll find powerful tools to oversee user accounts, track activities, and ensure proper licensing. Here’s a comprehensive overview of the key components covered in the manual:

- **User Management** - Establish and maintain user accounts within the system. Assign usernames, passwords, and essential contact details. Additionally, you have the authority to specify whether a user holds admin or super admin rights. Fine-tune access by controlling which modules each user can interact with (e.g., POS, Inventory, etc.).

- **User Activity Logs** - Access logs that capture user actions within the system. These logs reveal details such as data additions, edits, or deletions performed by users. You can filter logs based on date range and the type of activity. Effective monitoring ensures transparency and security.

- **Goods Received Log** - This specific log focuses on tracking goods received and purchase entries. It indicates whether an entry represents an edit to a previous receipt. Accurate tracking ensures efficient inventory management.

- **Licensing** - Upon software installation, enjoy an initial 7-day free trial. When ready, choose between a full license or extensions. Register your license by entering essential business details. The system even applies discounts based on the timing of your purchase.

By leveraging these features, you’ll establish robust administrative oversight, provision user accounts effectively, monitor security, and ensure compliance within the Managex software
